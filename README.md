# llvm-value-numbering
Implement and compare three value numbering techniques, local value numbering (LVN), super local value numbering (SVN) and dominator-tree-based global value numbering (GVN). Downgrade existing GVN.cpp to perform LVN and SVN using command line option -lvn and -svn respectively.
